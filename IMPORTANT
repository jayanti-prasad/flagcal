1. No changes in the algoritm have been made since 2010 and so this is still the original code.
2. The code is packed for:
./configure
make 
make install.
3. You must give the path pgplot and cfitsion when doing ./configure see the followinge example:
./configure --prefix=/home/jayanti/Research/RADIO/flagcal/2014/online/flagcal-1.0 CPPFLAGS="-I/data1/software/cfitsio/include/ -I/data1/software/pgplot" LDFLAGS="-L/data1/software/cfitsio/lib -L/data1/software/pgplot/"
4. You must have '.in' files which are given inside the example directory in which you want to run the code.
5. The main program is 'flagcal' which when run with no option suggest how to use it (in fact this is true for other programs also).

6. Compiler option is hadwired so you must have 'gcc'
