Listing of files changed by JNC in Sep 2011. These changes were made largely
1. To handle FITS files where the src_ids are arbitrary
2. To do assymetric flagging of source visibilities (where the statistics
   is non gaussian for faint sources)
3. To flag time ranges for which the median value is discrepant compared to
   the median value for the scan.
4. To preflag timeranges specified by the user as bad.

-------------------------

defs.h  
	New parameters and other variables needed for the changes made
        to the code.

find_bad_timerange.c 
        finds bad timeranges in a given baseline (i.e. whose 
        median value is discrepant from the median value for that scan).

flag_apply.c 
        modified to handle FITS files where the src_ids  can be arbitrary.

flag_data.c 
	modified to handle FITS files where the src_ids can be arbitrary.
flag.in 
        added the parameter BADTIMES which allows for specified timeranges
        to be flagged as soon as the data is read in (i.e. before any
        processing. The format is BADTIMES=d1,h1,m1,s1,d2,h2,m2,s2 to flag
        all the data between the specified day,hour,miniute and second.
        The time is measured as an offest from the timestamp for the first
        visibility in the FITS file.

flag_timerange.c
	flags data found as being bad in find_bad_timerange.c

flux_calib.c 
	modified to handle FITS files where the src_ids of the different 
	scans can be arbitrary.

gain_compute.c 
	modified to handle FITS files where the src_ids can be arbitrary.

gain_interpolate.c 
	modified to handle FITS files where the src_ids can be arbitrary.
		   
initilise.c 
	modified to handle FITS files where the src_ids can be arbitrary.
	A map idmap is set up between the src_id and the row number in the
	SU table of this source. All initializes the BADTIMES used for
        preflagging.

io.c 
        modified to handle FITS files where the src_ids can be arbitrary
	and read in BADTIMES specified by the user.

keywords.inc 
        added the new keywords used in flag_bad_timerange() etc.

mad.c 
        Added a check as to whether the routine is being called with
        n < 0

mad_filter.c 
        modified to handle FITS files where the src_ids can be arbitrary,
        and to flag timeranges in baselines where the median value is
        discrepant compared to the scan median (see find_bad_timerange.c)

main.c 
        added option to pre flag user specified BADTIMES

Makefile 
        changes for compiling on mage at Mt. Stromlo

makefile.in 
        changes to compile and link the new programs.

median.c 
        modified to check if the program is being called with n < 1

parameters.in 
        modified to include the new user control parameters that are
        for flag_bad_timerange() etc.

peak_remove.c 
	added the possibility of assymetric flagging for the target source
        visibilities to account for the non gaussian statistics of the
        visibility amplitude of weak sources.

read_fits.c 
        added code to preflag timeranges if the user has specified BADTIMES

remove_rfi.c 
	added the possibility of assymetric flagging for the target source
        visibilities to account for the non gaussian statistics of the
        visibility amplitude of weak sources.

setpara.inc 
        modified to include the new user control parameters that are
        for flag_bad_timerange() etc.

write_fits.c 
        modified to handle FITS files where the src_ids can be arbitrary,
